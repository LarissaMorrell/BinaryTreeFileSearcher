 This program takes text from a file and loads it into a 
 binary tree. Then the program searches the tree and outputs
 the frequency for commonly used words: "and", "or", "he", 
 "she", and "they". The program then searches for the number
 of words found only once in the text, the word at the root 
 of the tree, the words at the deepest branch of the tree,
 and the most frequently used word in the text.
